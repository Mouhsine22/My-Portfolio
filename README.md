<p align="justify">
In my current role, our strategy revolves around collecting data from multiple sources, transforming it, and loading it into a staging area. We implement change data capture to ensure data synchronization and keep information updated. Following this, we construct data warehouses and data marts tailored to various sectors within our organization. Additionally, we leverage tabular model to facilitate extensive calculations and data processing. Finally, we develop dashboards to present the insights derived from this process.
